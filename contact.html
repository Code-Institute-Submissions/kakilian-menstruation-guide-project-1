            <h2>What is menstruation?</h2>
            <p>
                Menstruation is the normal vaginal bleeding that happens in cycles. In earlier years, cycles
                typically range from 21 to 45 days, while in young adult life it's usually 21 to 31 days, continuing
                until around age 51. It can start anywhere from age 10 to 15 and varies based on individual body and
                diet.

                "Menstrual blood and tissue flow from your uterus through a small opening in your cervix and pass
                out of your body through your vagina. The uterus lining builds up to prepare for pregnancy."
                (Source: Women's Health)

            <h2>Symptoms?</h2>


            <p>
                Common symptoms, known as PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome), include breast tenderness, bloating,
                headaches, mood swings, depression, anxiety, anger, irritability, lower back pains, and diarrhea.
                These can occur one or two weeks before each period and usually ease up when the bleeding starts due
                to hormonal changes.
            </p>

            <!--needs a different image bright color for TIP - maybe a link or APP-->
            <h2> TIP </h2>
            <p>
                You can use an Ovaltion calender to keep track of your next menstruation. Itâ€™s also handy for your
                next womans GP appt. In the apps its easily adjustable to plot your PMS and will through the
                algorithm project your next PMS dates. Great to use, keep that updated.

            <h2>Myths Debunked:</h2>
            <ul class="myths">
                <li><strong>Fainting:</strong> Fainting during PMS or periods is unlikely due to minimal blood loss.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sports:</strong> You can still do sports during your period. Listen to your body, as
                    exercise can help with flow and pain relief.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hair Washing:</strong> Washing your hair is perfectly fine for hygiene. Daily showers or
                    baths are recommended for cleanliness and mood improvement.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Having your period isn't a secret. It's a normal bodily process that
                    shouldn't make you feel ashamed or abnormal.
                </li>
