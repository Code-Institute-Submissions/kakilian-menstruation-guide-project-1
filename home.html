                            Menstruation is the normal vaginal bleeding that happens in cycles. In earlier years, cycles
                            typically range from 21 to 45 days, while in young adult life it's usually 21 to 31 days,
                            continuing
                            until around age 51. It can start anywhere from age 10 to 15 and varies based on individual
                            body and
                            diet.

                            pass
                            out of your body through your vagina. The uterus lining builds up to prepare for pregnancy."

                            Common symptoms, known as PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome), include breast tenderness, bloating,
                            headaches, mood swings, depression, anxiety, anger, irritability, lower back pains, and
                            diarrhea.
                            These can occur one or two weeks before each period and usually ease up when the bleeding
                            starts due
                            to hormonal changes.

                        <h3>Myths Debunked:</h3>
                        <ul class="myths">
                            <li><strong>Fainting:</strong> Fainting during PMS or periods is unlikely due to minimal
                                blood loss.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Sports:</strong> You can still do sports during your period. Listen to your
                                body, as
                                exercise can help with flow and pain relief.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Hair Washing:</strong> Washing your hair is perfectly fine for hygiene. Daily
                                showers or
                                baths are recommended for cleanliness and mood improvement.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Having your period isn't a secret. It's a normal bodily
                                process that
                                shouldn't make you feel ashamed or abnormal.
                            </li>
