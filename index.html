                    <h1> .. a Menstruation Guide For Young Woman</h1>

                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>

                    <p>I'm a qualified nurse and mother of two girls. I understand the confusion and concerns that can
                        arise for young pre-teens, teenagers, and young adult women regarding menstruation. That's why
                        I've created an easy-to-understand guide to help navigate the experience, providing support,
                        clearing up myths, and emphasizing safety and hygiene.

                <h1>What is menstruation?</h1>
                <p>
                    Menstruation is the normal vaginal bleeding that happens in cycles. In earlier years, cycles
                    typically range from 21 to 45 days, while in young adult life it's usually 21 to 31 days, continuing
                    until around age 51. It can start anywhere from age 10 to 15 and varies based on individual body and
                    diet.
                </p>

                    "Menstrual blood and tissue flow from your uterus through a small opening in your cervix and pass
                    out of your body through your vagina. The uterus lining builds up to prepare for pregnancy."
                    (Source: Women's Health)

                <h1>Symptoms?</h1>


                <p>
                    Common symptoms, known as PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome), include breast tenderness, bloating,
                    headaches, mood swings, depression, anxiety, anger, irritability, lower back pains, and diarrhea.
                    These can occur one or two weeks before each period and usually ease up when the bleeding starts due
                    to hormonal changes.
                </p>

                <!--needs a different image bright color for TIP - maybe a link or APP-->
                <h1> TIP </h1>
                <p>
                    You can use an Ovaltion calender to keep track of your next menstruation. Itâ€™s also handy for your
                    next womans GP appt. In the apps its easily adjustable to plot your PMS and will through the
                    algorithm project your next PMS dates. Great to use, keep that updated.

                <h1>Myths Debunked:</h1>
                <ul class="myths">
                    <li><strong>Fainting:</strong> Fainting during PMS or periods is unlikely due to minimal blood loss.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Sports:</strong> You can still do sports during your period. Listen to your body, as
                        exercise can help with flow and pain relief.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Hair Washing:</strong> Washing your hair is perfectly fine for hygiene. Daily showers or
                        baths are recommended for cleanliness and mood improvement.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Having your period isn't a secret. It's a normal bodily process that
                        shouldn't make you feel ashamed or abnormal.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    There are two main things, I have broken them down to: Non-medical and medication. Always try the
                    non-medical things first, to see which fits your body best and when.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Self-Help Tips: Use warm bottles, blankets, drink water, reduce salt, alcohol, and caffeine intake,
                    take warm baths, rest, and consider supplements like calcium, Vitamin D, and Iron based on your
                    diet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Medication: Non-prescription anti-inflammatory drugs like Naproxen or Ibuprofen can help with
                    symptoms but should be taken under adult or doctor supervision.
                </p>
