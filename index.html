                        I am a qualified nurse, mother of 2 girls, and realise the miscommunicated Information that can form concern for young pre-teen, teenagers and young adult woman.
                        I have put together an easy to understand approach to first time menstruation, that are looking for support, to help them through their health concerns, to reassure, to clear some myths and generally staying safe, some hygienic aspects, with your well-being in mind.

            <h1>What is  menstruation?</h1>
            
            <p>

                Firstly, it is normal vaginal bleeding, that occurs in cycles,
                From 21 to 45 days in earlier years
                From 21 to 31 days in young adult lives, and right up until age 51.
                 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Is can start as young as 10 years old also up to 15 years of age. All ages are normal.
                It depends on the individual body, and diet.

            </p>

            <p>
                “Menstrual blood and tissue flow from your uterus through a small opening in your cervix and pass out of your body, though your Vagina. The uterus lining builds up to prepare for pregnancy”
                    Quelle “ Womans Health”

            <h3>Symptoms?</h3>
            <h4>Common symptoms, know as PMS – Premenstinal syndrome;</h4>
            
            <p>
                Breast tenderness, bloating, headaches, mood swings, depression, anxiety, anger and irritability, lower backpains and also diahorre.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            
            <p>
                During this period is an increase in hormone level change.
            </p>

            <!--image bright color for TIP-->
            <h3> TIP </h3>
            <p>
                You can use an Ovaltion calender to keep track of your next menstruation. It’s also handy for your next womans GP appt. In the apps its easily adjustable to plot your PMS and will through the algorithm project your next PMS dates. Great to use, keep that updated.
            </p>

            <!--image old photo, something silly thats well known-->
            <h3>House wife tales</h3>
            <p>
                Myth 1:
                Will I faint during my PMS, period?
                No, the blood loss is minimal, even tho it will seem there is a large amount of blood loss.
                 
            </p>
            <p>
                Myth 2:
                what? -No sports?
                Of course you can still do sports. You should listen to your body. Sports help the flow of the bleeding, and can relieve pain for some woman.
            </p>            
            <p>
                Myth 3:
                Don’t wash your hair?
                Oh, dear, have to be one of my favorite nonsense ones.
                Of course wash your hair, hygiene - daily showers, baths – keep yourself clean, when possible bath, keeps you fresh and will help relieve pains, symptoms,. Or and mood.

            </p>
            <p>
                Myth 4:
                Will people know?
                You wont have a “I have my PMS written anywhere on your body” so no.
                Having your period isn’t a dirty secret. You should never feel like, “I’ve done something wrong” or “I’m not normal”.
                It’s a completely normal body process beginning early on in younger years.

            <h1>Guidance </h1>
            <h3>What can I do? - self awareness</h3>

            <p>
                There are two main things, I have broken them down to: Non-medical and medication. Always try the non-medical things first, to see which fits your body best and when.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hotwater Bottle</li>
                <li>Warm Blanket</li>
                <li>Drink on your peroid days, more water</li>
                <li>Reduce: salt, (alcohol, caffeine) intake</li>
                <li>Warm baths</li>
                <li>Rest</li>
                <li>Supplements, like calium, Vitamin D, and Iron, all depending on your diet.</li>
                <li>Eat fresh vegatables, meat. Try and avoid fatty processed foods, eg Fastfoods</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Antiflammatory?</li>
                <li>should only be taken with guidance from an adult or your House or Womans GP</li>
                <li>Naxproxen or ibuprofen both should be taken after eating, to protect your stomachs lining. Also the dosiage and intervals to watch for. In the tablette box is a beipackzettel – use this to see how much for my weight and age am I allow, also the duration. Here I would strongly suggest only to take under supervision!</li>
            </ul>

            <p> And remember, you are not alone!</p>

            <h1>Materials for hygiene Management</h1>
            <p>
                Our femini hygiene range is wide, using the right product for your age and need .
                Here I have listed 3 general materials to choose from:
            </p>
<!--sub-titles, in flex-box-->
            <ul>
                <li>Sanitary pads:
                    Come in different sizes and also for times of day, being when you sleep, itll seem like theres an increasei nbleeding- really its your not awake and not using the toilette like during the day.
                    These are disposable, one use products. Which should be placed in the rubbish bin. Not in the toilet
                    </li>
                <li>Special menstrual underwear:
                    Its good to have at least three of these, as a general, look online or local drogy stores. Eg. Shops DM. Rossman carry these. They are to be used with pads to help stop the overflow, or occasional accident that can happen. Until you get used to your body changes.
                    </li>
                <li>Tampoons:
                    If your not sexual active your first choice should be pads.
                    Tampoons you place inside the Vagina, and can be painful as a new user. I suggest using later starting around 18 and up. They are a great, if used accordingly!
                    Every toilet to be changed.
                    Using the right size, for the different flow.
                    Don’t leave the tampoon inside your Vagina, and forget it, it can cos infection and also lead to death.
                    Missing tampoons should be removed immediately, need be from your womans GP.
                    </li>
            </ul>
