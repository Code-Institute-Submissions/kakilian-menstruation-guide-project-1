        I tried to bring a simple and also clear message, website is made for "teens". All welcome. Everyone! - the Topic may be happening to girls/woman - it is also apart of familys - sisters to brothers or a friend. To help everyone have a small simple look into what is going on.

### Font 
        I decided to use an all over easy access FONT. Possible Access for All! lato and Oswald. I did think about making a type of written font, decided against it, due to the fact there were comments in font-google, that not all mobile phones would be supported with fonts I thought would be good. For sure modern telephones. Looking at my target Audience, though experience -mostly get their parents or hand me down Mobilphones from family or friends.
